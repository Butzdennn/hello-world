CATHOLIC IMAGES: ICONS OR IDOLS?
What are idols?
Ex 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any IDOL, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:

Ex 20:5 Thou shalt not BOW DOWN (SHACHAH) thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;
What was prohibited to do to an idol is “shachah”? 
shachah  shaw-khaw’
a primitive root;
to depress, i.e. prostrate (especially reflexive, in homage to royalty or God).
IN OTHER DICTIONARY “shachah” MEANS “prostrate in homage to superior”
“shachah” suggests 3 things:

1. Prostrate or bow down

2. prostrate in homage to royalty or superior

3. prostrate in homage to god.

GOD PROHIBITS PROSTRATION TO AN IDOL IN HOMAGE TO ROYALTY, SUPERIOR OR GOD as the message of EX 20:4-5.

If you are prohibited to prostrate to an idol in homage to god then that would imply that the idol is considered by its worshippers as God. There are worshippers that consider an idol god thus an idol is any image considered god and is venerated (homage) by prostration or bowing down.

An example of such worshippers: (CONSIDERING IDOLS AS GODS)

saiah 42:17 NASB

[17] They will be turned back and be utterly put to shame, Who trust in idols, Who say TO MOLTEN IMAGES, “You are our gods.”
If you are prohibited to prostrate to an idol in homage to royalty or superior then that would imply the idol is considered by its worshippers as royalty or superior.

WHY WOULD GOD PROHIBITS BOWING DOWN TO AN IDOL IN HOMAGE TO ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR IF THE IDOL IS NOT AN IMAGE OF ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR TO ITS WORSHIPPERS?

An example of such worshippers: (CONSIDERING IDOLS AS IMAGES OF ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR)

Num 25:2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their  ELOHIM (GODS OR GREAT ONES) and the people did eat, and bowed down to their ELOHIM (GODS OR GREAT ONES)

Num 25:3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
Great ones are the idols. Great suggests royalty or superior. People consider idols GREAT ONES as images of royalty or superior but then it is idolatry as transgression to the law: DO NOT BOW DOWN TO IDOLS IN HOMAGE TO ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR.

IDOLS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GODS BUT ALSO IMAGES OF GREAT ONES (royalty or superior) AS SUGGESTED BY WHAT WAS PROHIBITED: “shachah”. 

SUPERIOR OR ROYALTY ALSO REFERS TO WHAT IMAGES REPRESENTS SUCH AS MARY AND THE SAINTS, LOGICALLY, SPEAKING…
so what is an idol then?

any image (and what it represents) considered as god, royalty or superior which is being given homage to by prostration or bowing down.
The catholic images represent ROYAL, GREAT OR SUPERIOR FIGURES such as jesus Christ, mary and the saints, they are being rendered homage to or veneration through bowing down intentionally thus catholic images are idols as transgression to what was prohibited: DO NOT BOW DOWN TO IDOLS IN HOMAGE TO ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR.
what is an icon?

Re 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the ICON of the beast, that the ICON of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not WORSHIP the ICON of the beast should be killed.
Catholics said an icon is not an idol. It is not considered God. IDOLATRY TO THEM IS CONSIDERING AN IMAGE GOD.
They said the catholic images are icons so that means worshipping the icon of the beast is not idolatry?

Is that true?

But the verse below is speaking of an icon which is an abomination.
Ro 1:23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an ICON made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

Ro 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

Ro 1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
ICONS OR IDOLS?

 CATHOLICS TRANSGRESS A PRIMITIVE LAW OF GOD:

DO NOT BOW DOWN TO IDOLS IN HOMAGE TO ROYALTY OR SUPERIOR
That would suggests idols as images of royalty or superior and not always as god. Bec catholics consider jesus, mary and the saints as figures of greatness (royalty or superior) they do idolatry when they give homage to them by bowing down to their images. Doing that makes their images idols.
